# Music_Advisor
Personal music advisor that makes preference-based suggestions and even shares links to new releases and featured playlists. Program is based on HTTP client-server communication with Spotify REST API. To authenticate concrete user with Spotify was used OAuth protocol (basic information [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPbvxxslDTU&ab_channel=InterSystemsLearningServices)). To parse JSON request from server was used [GSON library](https://howtodoinjava.com/gson/gson-jsonparser)

## Commands

* `auth` Provides a link to the Spotify authorization page and waits until user confirms or rejects the authorization.
* `new` Shows list of new albums with artists and links on Spotify.

## Authrization Steps for developers
1. Go to the site of the corresponding API and create the application there to get `client_id` and `client_secret`.
2. After registered the application and received the client_id and client_secret, create an authorization link which will contain, in query parameters, the `client_id`, `redirect_uri` , `response_type`, and `scopes`.
3. The user follows this link and authorizes access, and is redirected back to the developerâ€™s specified redirect_uri with the response.
4. The developer uses this response to get access_token.
